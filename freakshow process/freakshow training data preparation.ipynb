      "Black celebrity began at the freak show. When Phillis Wheatley appeared before the great men of Massachusetts in 1772, it was not as the first African-American woman poet but as a vexing human oddity—“an uncultivated Barbarian from Africa” who could write. The supposedly high-minded owners who submitted her to examination were not so different from the showman P. T. Barnum, who in 1835 launched his career with the purchase of an elderly, paralytic slave woman named Joice Heth. Barnum exhibited Heth as George Washington’s 161-year-old “mammy,” using her black body to catapult him from dry goods salesman to global entertainment icon. She was the first in a long chain of “African entertainments”—Zip the Pinhead, the Duck-Billed Ubangis, the pygmy Ota Benga—on whose backs Barnum and his successors rode to glory. They were the sacrificial lambs of modern entertainment, and they have been, as individuals, almost entirely forgotten. George and Willie Muse, sideshow performers for dime museums and circuses including Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey, were known for most of their lives as “Eko and Iko,” often trailing sobriquets like “Darwin’s Missing Links” or “Ambassadors from Mars.” Done up in tuxedos and wearing their blond hair in tangled dreads, they traveled across America being ogled, silent but for the music they played in accompaniment. Hype men told the journalists and rubes in the sideshow tent that they had been found in the Amazon or had crashed their spaceship in the Mojave desert. The prosaic truth was that they were albino black brothers from Truevine, Virginia, abducted sometime around 1899 by a six-fingered ticket-seller named James Herman “Candy” Shelton. At least if the family is to be believed. One of the story’s many lacunae concerns whether George and Willie were initially kidnapped, or contracted out by their mother Harriet, who lost track of the boys after Shelton absconded with them at the end of the circus season. Whatever the case, Shelton told the brothers that Harriet, an illiterate laundress, was dead; in fact, she would spend more than thirteen years seeking their return, and a lifetime fighting Ringling Bros. for back pay and fair treatment. The surprise is, she won. Beth Macy’s Truevine is a moving attempt to reconstruct this David and Goliath story, a chronicle of the Muses’ unlikely victory in a game that was doubly rigged against them. It is a tale of two circuses, Ringling’s and Jim Crow’s, turning on the axis between segregation’s invisible subjugation and the spectacular exploitation that was, for the Muses as for so many black performers, the only way out of it. The pattern is one we know well, a struggle between nonwhite entertainers and their would-be handlers that is ongoing. Whether it’s Eddie Huang and ABC, Colin Kaepernick and the NFL, or Leslie Jones and the trolls of Twitter, the mistreatment of people of color in entertainment has increasingly become an explicit interest of popular culture. At such a moment, there is a certain clarity in returning to the stark beginnings of representational injustice. If even “Eko and Iko” can be given back their stories, there might be hope for us all.  Macy, a white journalist, undertakes her vindication of the Muses in a spirit of something like penitence. She is a longtime features writer for the Roanoke Times, an old Virginia daily that, as she is at pains to tell us, not only mocked the Muses’ story of George and Willie’s kidnapping, but for many decades generally abused the region’s black population. There is also a thread of personal redemption: In the first chapter, Macy admits to having once written an article on teen pregnancy that, despite her best intentions, became viral fodder for racist talk radio. Restoring the Muses’ voices is framed as a form of atonement. This is a serious challenge. Eko and Iko, like most of the African and pseudo-African circus attractions of the so-called Zulu ticket, had to maintain a silence conducive to the illusion that they were authentic savages, barely capable of human speech. George and Willie left few recollections in their own words, and their surviving relatives have maintained a stubborn privacy. Macy spent more than a decade proving to the Muse brothers’ niece Nancy Saunders that she wasn’t “one more candy peddler,” or “just another white person stirring up shit.” You can hardly blame her for her caution. The contemporary press treated George and Willie atrociously, legitimizing their captivity by regurgitating all the “ballyhoo” (wild, improvised performer biographies) that the high carnies could cook up. When the Muses were reunited in 1927, most papers entirely omitted Harriet’s successful lawsuit against Ringling Brothers, in which she won a large settlement and guarantee of regular fair pay for her sons. (She eventually used the money to purchase a house, where the brothers lived comfortably until their deaths.) Journalists preferred to run interference for the circus. When the brothers went back to “The Greatest Show on Earth” after their victory in court, The New Yorker came up with a “fun” explanation for their actions—at home, “the fried chicken had soon given out.” Macy is admirably undaunted by the family’s privacy and her predecessors’ distortions. Her sense of duty to George and Willie is best expressed in a quote from a historian friend, which serves as the principle of her narrative: “If we only wrote the histories of the people who left detailed records we would only get to know about the really privileged people. You have to piece together your evidence with empathy and conjecture.” So much of this evidence is irreparably marred that a difficult question occurs: Can we discover the authentic voices of the exploited behind, or within, the propaganda of their exploiters? A recent spate of histories have answered “yes.” Along with an overview of African Entertainments Abroad by Bernth Lindfors in 2014, the last few years have seen biographies of Saartjie Baartman, the “Hottentot Venus,” by Clifton Crais and Pamela Scully in 2010; of Franz “Clicko” Taibosh, the “Dancing Bushman,” by Neil Parsons in 2010; and of Ota Benga, the Bronx Zoo pygmy, by Pamela Newkirk in 2015. Many of these books are the first legitimate biographies of these performers, who left few if any reflections in their own words—fruit of a recent conviction that the stories of the men and women behind the masks of racist art and entertainment, however scant their traces, are worth recovering and even reinventing. It is a project that artists have been at for decades. In his satirical novel Mumbo Jumbo (1972), Ishmael Reed invents a spiritual germ called “Jes Grew” to account for black culture’s transformative influence on twentieth-century America. It is a virus of reappropriation, taking racist depictions of black culture and “infecting” them (often comically) with the very stories they were devised to suppress. (A good example of “Jes Grew” art might be Joe Overstreet’s “The New Jemima,” a 1964 painting in which the headkerchiefed waffle icon appears as a revolutionary with an automatic weapon.) More recently, the scholar Glenda Carpio’s Laughing Fit To Kill (2008) tracked the ways that artists from Richard Pryor to Kara Walker have conjured similar reversals, using black humor to make the muzzled specters of the racist imagination—the mammy, the minstrel, the African savage with a bone through his nose—speak. Even museum artifacts are joining the chorus: The title poem of Robin Coste Lewis’s National Book Award–winning Voyage of the Sable Venus (2015) uses prosody alone to turn a centuries-long catalogue of museum objects depicting black women—often as decorative elements in furniture—into an elegiac restitution of erased interiorities. It is this kind of restitution that Macy is after in Truevine, a book which, in spite of the paucity of available information, aims to reattach Eko and Iko to the “true vine” of their roots as George and Willie Muse. Warm, personable, and empathetically speculative, it centers on experiences that shed light on the brothers’ inner lives: a trip to England on the RMS Majestic, the first reunion with their mother, a shared love of animals and music. Where the record is silent, Macy draws on the better-known biographies of the Muses’ fellow performers to give us a sense of the worlds George and Willie moved in, and how they might have felt. Jack Earle, Ringling’s “Texas Giant,” reflected at length on his status as a sideshow attraction in paintings, photographs, and poems. The Ubangis, a group of Congolese women with artificially extended lips, were hard-driving negotiators who constantly tortured an effigy of their manager. (They retired to a lavish ranch in their home country.) But Truevine contains little direct testimony about how the Muse brothers saw themselves as performers, as black men who passed for Martians, as pawns on the game board of American entertainment. You can’t fault a writer for not discovering what isn’t there to be known. But it’s hard to escape the sense that some of the time Macy spends developing the Muse brothers’ scant personal history might have been better spent on a subject she assiduously avoids: the attraction of their stage personae as sideshow freaks. The omission is understandable. As a white person writing about an African-American family, a “normal” person writing about human oddities, and a journalist working with mistrustful sources, Macy faces a number of hurdles—and is clearly aware of them. Before beginning the narrative proper, she quotes the critic Leslie Fiedler: “Nobody can write about Freaks without somehow exploiting them for his own ends.” Keen to avoid the worst of this voyeurism, Macy chooses to focus on the backstage drama between the conniving manager, the courageous mother, and the largely passive (but ultimately victorious) George and Willie Muse. But what about the other drama, the one between Eko and Iko and their savage-hungry audience? Truevine all but takes for granted that albino black men in early-twentieth-century America were titillating, without much delving into why that might have been. The book’s most glaring flaw is its unwillingness to make a study of the sideshow’s spectators, consumers for whom racial drag, along with other category-confounding paradoxes, were essential components of circus fun. Audiences were drawn to the “fearsome pleasure” involved in muddling the “natural” order that governed their worlds—the mixture of attraction and threat that Eric Lott’s Love & Theft, a book on blackface minstrelsy, calls the “mystery of color.” A similar dynamic must have been at play in the case of the “white savages,” whose allure was in the supposed incongruity between their African features and unpigmented skin. It was a fascination born of colonialism and its attendant anxieties, of a guilty xenophobia evident in Eko and Iko’s outlandish honorifics. Dubbed “Ethiopian Monkey Men,” “Sheep-Headed Cannibals from Ecuador,” and “Ministers from Dahomey” they were usually cast as hailing from empires’ anxious outer limits. Dahomey, a powerful kingdom in what is now Benin, was conquered by France in 1892; in the aftermath, Dahomeans were exhibited in an artificial village at Chicago’s 1893 Columbian Exposition. Ethiopia had even more remote, insurrectionary connotations. Twice invaded by Italy, it was for most of the twentieth century Africa’s one holdout against European control. Ersatz natives of these and other regions, Eko and Iko were like captured barbarians in a Roman triumph—a model toward which the pioneers of the circus clearly aspired. After the United Kingdom deposed the Zulu monarch Cetewayo, P. T. Barnum offered Queen Victoria $100,000 to exhibit him abroad. He was refused, but the performers of “Zulu ticket” would fill the same need. Their bodies, made nonthreatening by comedy and “science,” were used to pacify an audience unsettled by the unknown; an unknown that their civilizations were swiftly wiping from the map. The irony of Eko and Iko—imaginary castaways from Mars or the borderlands of the West—was that the captivity and estrangement they play-acted was not so far from their reality. Like the Dahomeans of Chicago’s Midway, they were the subjugated natives of a conquered territory: African-Americans from a “Redeemed” post-Reconstruction South that, as much as any distant colony, had been seized from its inhabitants by force. It’s hard to say whether this ever occurred to George and Willie Muse; if, from behind their sideshow masks, they ever found a way to sneak it out the sides of their mouths. What’s certain is that others picked up the realm of racial fantasy within which they were imprisoned and made it their own, no longer a degrading sideshow but a big top of otherworldly possibility. Sun Ra, the avant-garde jazz musician famous for his extraterrestrial aspirations, appears in his 1974 film Space is the Place as an envoy from another world: a freak in an eyeball-shaped ship with funny clothes, “a mid-size solar Arkestra” and a plan for the salvation of the black race. After reading Macy’s book, it is hard not to view Ra, born Herman Poole Blount in 1914 in Birmingham, Alabama, or the androgynous android Cindi Mayweather, born Janelle Monáe Robinson in 1985 in Kansas City, as inheritors of Truevine, Virginia’s “Ambassadors from Mars.”  To some people—perhaps including Truevine’s author—placing freak shows at the origin of this tradition might seem distasteful. But this is how black performance began in America—as a farce fertile with possibilities, a sideshow of captives that “Jes Grew” into the Greatest Show on Earth.

Will the G-20 make any progress toward solving the problems of bloodshed, misery and insecurity in the Middle East, North and Central Africa, East and Central Europe, the Korean Peninsula and the rest of East Asia? The answer to both questions is no. Germany — the host country presiding over the summit's proceedings — is too busy fretting about America's exit from the agreement on climate change, the new administration's alleged trade protectionism and its increasingly strict homeland security policies affecting travel, migration and immigration issues. Instead of carping on problems that have been discussed ad nauseam in other talking forums, Germany should have concentrated on the G-20's essential mission to promote world economic growth and financial stability. An appropriate starting point would have been to suggest that the euro area, with a trade surplus of $385 billion (where Germany accounts for $272 billion), an unemployment rate of 9.3 percent, tepid GDP growth of 1.9 percent and an inflation rate of 1.4 percent should lead the world economy to higher jobs and incomes with expansionary economic policies. The same policy posture should have been advocated for East Asia, where a $643 billion trade surplus indicates a great potential for stronger domestic demand and growing purchases from the rest of the world. What we have here is that some wealthy countries are getting richer on the back of the rest of the world — with a huge annual trade surplus of $1.03 trillion. And here is the ultimate irony: These surplus countries are ignoring their obligations under the rules of the international trade adjustment while accusing the U.S. of trade protectionism. Some chutzpah, isn't it? But all that is Washington's fault. Had the White House insisted that the G-20 focus on the key objective of stronger and (trade) balanced world economy, the U.S. could have reduced its trade deficit — running at an annual rate of $730 billion in the first four months of this year — and drawn more growth and tax income from international trade. That would have helped to avoid a politically suicidal $250 billion in spending cuts on Medicaid and food stamps (healthcare and food assistance programs). Even people sympathetic to the administration are voicing concerns that principles of equity and social justice are not being served by hitting the poor while slashing taxes for corporations and the middle class. That is an ominous development in the run-up to next year's Congressional elections that could seal the fate of the presidency and a Republican control of the legislative authority. As things now stand, the next G-20 summit is a gigantic waste of taxpayers' money and a big yawn for world's financial markets. Sadly, it is also Washington's wasted opportunity to turn the tables on trade freeloaders masquerading as free traders. What is left are the possibilities of separate, bilateral meetings of American, Chinese and Russian leaders to talk peace and security on the (expensive) sidelines of the Hamburg jamboree. Here are some of the issues these three countries will have to discuss. Starting with Europe, the U.S. and Russia will have to decide what to do about the long-standing problems of the continent's security architecture, unresolved since the end of WWII, and reappearing in an acute form on the global agenda as people realized that Russia did not wither away after a debilitating agony during its horrendous decade of the 1990s. The good people of Ukraine are dying every day of bullets, hunger and destitution, while the Minsk peace process lies dead in the water. Ukraine is the most prominent case of chaos, waste and unbearable human suffering in the middle of Europe, but several regions in the Balkans are also a slow-burning fuse where killings, ethnic strife and intractable security issues have to be dealt with, while Washington and Moscow trade accusations of sowing mayhem. And then there are the EU's north-south problems. Polish and Baltic fears of Russian invasion are dismissed by South Europeans as grotesque exaggerations at the time when Italians and Greeks keep desperately calling for help in dealing with thousands of people arriving — and perishing — daily on makeshift boats from North Africa and the Middle East, seeking escape from death, hunger and deprivation. Europe's former colonial powers, and the EU, have failed to help establish some degree of security, good governance and economic development to prevent Africa's massive exodus that Europe cannot, or will not, handle. China has a large and increasing economic presence in Africa and in the Middle East. It, therefore, must play a role — together with the U.S. and Russia — in setting up a credible framework for peace and economic progress in these troubled regions. Beijing's \"Belt and Road\" initiative can be one of the vehicles to promote trade and infrastructure investments in the Middle East and North Africa, but that can only happen if the U.S. and Russia could agree on the future of war-torn Syria and Libya, and on the way to manage an increasingly dangerous Iranian-Saudi confrontation. And nothing can be done without an American-Chinese agreement about the Korean Peninsula, contested territorial claims in the South and East China Seas, and the freedom of navigation and commerce along the world's busiest sea and air routes in the Asia Pacific. Speaking at the White House Rose Garden last Friday, President Donald Trump said that the \"strategic patience with the North Korean regime has failed.\" China says it has done all it could for now, and Russia is stepping forward with its own plan for Pyongyang to stop missile and nuclear tests, and to get rid of nuclear weapons it already has. South Koreans are ready to talk, too. A recent opinion poll shows that 76.9 percent of South Koreans support the resumption of the inter-Korean dialog about peace and nuclear disarmament. Diplomacy is urged because it is not clear whether reasonable military solutions exist to security problems posed by the nuclear-armed North Korea. Negotiated solutions are also seen as the only way to resolve problems of rival claims on China's maritime borders. Rehashing problems about climate change, free trade and migration policies — amply discussed in other multilateral talking forums — the next G-20 meeting is missing a chance to address the crucially important issue of the economic policy coordination to strengthen and accelerate the global business cycle by reducing destabilizing trade imbalances. The meeting, therefore, is of no particular interest to world asset markets. The G-3 will discuss on the sidelines of the Hamburg meeting the ways of (a) stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, Middle East and North and Central Africa, (b) resolving the nuclear standoff on the Korean Peninsula and (c) reconciling contested territorial claims in the South and East China Seas. But the cause of peace will only be properly served when the nuclear armed G-3 finally acknowledges there are no military solutions to their rivalries. At some point they will do that. It will take an act of enlightened statesmanship to change behaviors, and to have that explained to their respective constituencies. Meanwhile, investors have only two lodestars: The Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. Those two central banks know what has to be done to keep the world economy afloat. It is a great pity that the G-20 governments are failing to use that monetary platform to build a more balanced global economic system through appropriately coordinated fiscal, structural and trade policies.

      "This year’s Strawberry Festival carnival will feature a classic sideshow as Hawthorne’s Circus Bizarre will partner with Kissel Entertainment. Hawthorne’s Circus Bizarre will be performing continuous shows nightly May 9-13 during the Tennessee Strawberry Festival in Dayton. Touring this year with Kissel Entertainment, officials said this may be the only chance to see one of the last traveling sideshows in the country. Once a staple in the Sideshow/carnival industry, sideshows have all but disappeared from the Midway. Hawthorne’s Circus Bizarre is one of the last remaining sideshows that’s still tours full time under a tent. From March to November 2017 “The Most Unusual Show in America” will be seen in many cities from Pensacola, Fla., up to Indiana. Under this tent festival-goers will find a historical museum of oddities from around the world — some items from sideshows that toured over 100 years ago. Along with a blast from the past, attendees will get a live show of skill, feats of strength and pain resistance. Hawthorne, the modern-day mystic, eats and manipulates fire masterfully, while this year’s cohort, Ember, walks on razor sharp glass, climbs the infamous Ladder of Swords and lies on a bed of nails. Audiences witness live human electrocution as Hawthorne uses the power of his mind to let the power of electricity flow harmlessly through his body while sitting in a real 1940’s prison electric chair. The show also includes live exhibits such as Spiderella, who has the adorable face of an angel attached the giant eight-legged body of a spider and “The Headless Wonder”— a live headless lady. All attractions are presented as fun, family entertainment. All this and more can be seen at carnivals and festivals this tour season in Florida, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky and Indiana. “Traveling tent sideshows are a true dying art form so, turn off the TV and step outside into Hawthorne’s Circus Bizarre to see real live entertainment at its best and most unusual,” officials said.

Explain the impact of technology on every industry. The world is evolving at unprecedented speeds, the rules that we used to rely on to operate no longer apply, and never before have we felt such a pressing need to redefine the norms in order to remain relevant, in order for an industry continue to exist in next decade. As Steve Jobs said:The best way to predict the future is to invent it.The impact of technology on the vast majority of companies is existential – from healthcare to consumer goods to manufacturing. We must all evolve to carve a new spot for ourselves in the new world order. BCX Disrupt is ‘not just a tech summit’, because tech is no longer an option or an afterthought or a sideshow, it's the main show of all our organisations. Disruption is everywhere at the moment. How can brands safeguard themselves against being disrupted by the next big thing? The only way brands and companies can safeguard themselves against being disrupted is to be part of the disruption and disrupt themselves so they can reap some of the benefits that will come. Sitting back is simply not an option for any competitive industry. Leigh Andrews  13 Nov 2017 Even large organisations need to find opportunities to innovate at the fringes, outside of the bureaucratic, change-resistant core, where experiments can occur more freely. This requires courageous leadership and the right partnerships and advisors to make happen. Talk us through the importance of conferences like BCX Disrupt and the power of sharing the impact of technology and innovation with the youth. In the words of William Gibson, “The future is already here, it just not evenly distributed.” BCX Disrupt providing satellite events is a powerful initiative to evenly distribute that future to those that need it most – the youth. Leigh Andrews  14 Nov 2017 More importantly, all the great innovations our businesses and society needs will have to be driven by the youth – we need them on the journey as their perspective of the world will naturally be years ahead of the rest of us and we have to work with all the insights we can gather to deliver innovative solutions. What can attendees look forward to from your session at the BCX Disrupt Summit? I will be talking about how we move from innovative ideas to profitable solutions and further exploring what profit means today. The age of sustainably achieving profits by making money out of others is fast disappearing into the distance. It is no longer sufficient to score singular wins. The new economy demands that innovation and new solutions create shared value, where you make money by making money with your customers – for your customers.I bring my experience as a technology entrepreneur as well as global examples to drive key lessons for creating sustainable value for all. Interesting. What are you personally most looking forward to from the Summit? I am a major Malcolm Gladwell fan, having read most of his books. I will also most certainly be attending his Masterclass and am thrilled to be sharing a panel with such great minds!  8 Nov 2017 Seems the claim is true that attendees will never think the same again!

The officer suffered minor injuries when he was dragged a short distance by the driver. The BPD is investigating the incident. (Tony Kukulich/The Press)  UPDATE: December 11, 2017 9:00am- Lt. Walter O’Grodnick of the Brentwood Police Department confirmed on Monday evening that one of the primary vehicles involved in the incident was found. Additionally, four arrests have been made. Two of those arrested are juveniles. Further details are being withheld while the investigation is ongoing. The injured officer was treated for a minor foot injury and released. His name is not being released. O’Grodnick said that the department is planning to release more information on the investigation later this week. ************************************************************** A Brentwood police officer was injured when he confronted a driver suspected of participating in a sideshow on Sunday night. Sgt. Steven Daansen said the officer was dragged for a short distance by the driver of the vehicle. According to Daansen, the officer was transported by ambulance to an area hospital for treatment of minor injuries, though he declined to specify the exact nature of the officer’s injuries. The incident began shortly before midnight when police were called to Lone Tree Way and Brentwood Boulevard. They arrived to find 30-35 vehicles participating in a sideshow in the intersection. Daansen said that officers were pelted with beer cans, the evidence of which were scattered across the intersection, before drivers scattered in every direction. The Contra Costa Country Department of the Sheriff’s Office was called to the scene to assist the Brentwood Police Department. Deputies briefly detained a driver who returned to the area, though he was eventually released. The Brentwood Police Department is reviewing video obtained of the incident and their investigation is continuing. Not a subscriber?  Click here to add your comment to the story!
